                My personal favorite! This is a recipe for a dry martini, because putting an olive in a beverage is ludicrous and disgusting! The first known recipe for a martini was published in Harry Johnson's Bartnder Manual in 1888, intended as a variation of a Manhattan. The recipe called for old tom gin, vermouth, orange curacao, gomme syrup, Boker's bitters, and a lemon twist.

                Combine two and half ounces of gin and half an ounce of dry vermouth in a shaker with lots of ice. Shake well and strain into a preferably chilled cocktail glass. Express and Garnish with a lemon twist.
